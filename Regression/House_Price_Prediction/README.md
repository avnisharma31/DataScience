# Loan Approval Classifier Advanced Techniques

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to build and compare different machine learning models for loan approval classification. The notebook covers the following steps:

- Data Sanity checks
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning and optimization
- Model interpretation and explanation

The models used in this project are:
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

The notebook also uses various libraries and tools such as:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Optuna
- SHAP

The notebook can be run on Google Colab or locally with the required dependencies installed.
